Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro with Tailwind CSS! Here I will be creating some blog text.

## What I've done

1. **Installing Astro**: I followed steps on tutorial to create Astro project on VSCode.

2. **Making Pages**: Then I learned how to make simple static pages using `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages` folder.

3. **Creating First Post**: Making this Markdown blog post and render it using Astro.

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep learning this cool framework.
